## Overview

This project is the foundation for the next generation of Reaction Commerce
software.

## Features

* A microservices based architecture.
* Docker based development environment.
* Services are pre-wired and ready to run locally with a single CLI command.

### Project Structure

Reaction NEXT is build upon a microservices architecture. The
[reaction-next][8] project is a shell that contains build tools to bootstrap
the environment.

Each microservice will be cloned as a child directory within this project.

## Prerequisites

* [Git][5]
* [Docker][0] | [Docker for Mac][1] | [Docker for Windows][2]
* [NodeJS][3]
* [Yarn][4]
* A [Github][6] account with a [configured SSH key][7]

## Getting started

First, clone this repository.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:reactioncommerce/reaction-next.git

cd reaction-next
```

#### Bootstrapping

From within the project directory run:

```sh
make
```

This process may take some time. Behind the scenes `make` is

* checking that dependencies are present
* cloning the sub projects
* downloading Docker images
* building custom, project Docker images
* starting services

## Services

When the initial `make` command is complete you can use these services:
